 <p>The hyperlink above, will take you to the module PDF document addressing, the thoughts and what i learned from each module.</p>
  <p><b>Bellow, we will have another link to the Data i have used to Make my hypotheses as well as, questions i had. A lot of my questions, 
 and so on will be below or above the link to the google spreadsheet.</b></p>

 <p style="text-align:center">What kind of information can we gather from this data. What stands out to everyone, will it show possible model for set 
vechile? Will it show where the vechile is located at and what city or town it is in as of right now? Looking through the data what do we physically know. As we 
go down in all the car data, we can assure that Clean Alternative Fuel Vehicle (CAFV) Eligibility effects it very much, as we go down 
a lot of the cars are Teslas and as we change to other cars like Mercedes or Kia it effects it, as well as the range.</p>

<p style="text-align:center">As you look at the data above, or the link i have posted. You can see what data is presented, from the vechiles Vin, Range. To even where
 its located at. Yes, it shows where the vechile is located at the moment, it as well shows the <strong>MODEL</strong> of the vechile. As we continue to look the data we 
 notice how (CAFV) takes a huge impact on how many people have bought the vechiles if they are good for the environment, 
 as shown Mercedes and Kia, and other ones compared to tesla have low range, or no data shown if its a good elternative for us.
