       <strong>Data Tools</strong>

<ul>
  <p>Data tools, I have learned a lot through out this proccess. Learning different types of writtings and so much different type of tools. 
  From Databases, to spreadsheets and even text Files to even graphs. I learned that when it comes to data bases, they have their own unique kind of language
  called "query language." Which was basically code, being structed into information or as people call it data. When it comes to using these data tools
  if you don't have "data" or facts then nothing would work for you. You see when working with data tools such as spread sheets or data bases. 
  You need some facts so then, you can calcute statistics. This will basically gather everything you just told us; and well calculate what you need to know. 
  For example, in a spreadsheet you can put calclate how many hours someone has worked a week because of the <strong>DATA</strong> You have entered. You have to remember
  if you mess something up; well there goes your data, nothing would be calculated right, and it all won't be accurate. As i tookt his module, i learned that every
  small deatil counts. </p>
