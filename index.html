  <p>Taking this Data tools, I have learned a lot through out this proccess. Learning different types of writtings and so much different type of tools. 
  From Databases, to spreadsheets and even text Files. I learned that when it comes to data bases, they have their own unique kind of language
  called "query language." Which was basically code, being structed into information or as people call it data. </p>
